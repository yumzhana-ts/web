"I would rather be a beggar and wander freely than a rich man who is always in fear. 
For riches bring cares, and cares bring sorrow, and sorrow takes away the delight of 
living. True happiness lies not in abundance of gold or in pomp and glory, but in the 
freedom to live according to one's own mind, in learning, in friendship, in laughter, 
and in the pursuit of wisdom. Let us not spend our days counting coins when we might 
be counting the stars or the joys of the soul."
